# Simple IMC Calculator App

This Markdown file provides a brief overview of a simple IMC (Body Mass Index) calculator app developed using Vanilla JavaScript.

## Overview

The IMC calculator app is a basic web application that allows users to calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI) based on their weight and height inputs. BMI is a numerical value of a person's weight in relation to their height and is commonly used to assess whether a person is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese.

The app takes the user's weight in kilograms and height in centimeters as inputs, and upon clicking the "Calculate" button, it displays the calculated BMI along with a message indicating the user's BMI category.

## Features

1. **Input Fields**: The app provides input fields for the user to enter their weight and height.

2. **Calculate Button**: After entering the weight and height, the user can click the "Calculate" button to initiate the BMI calculation.

3. **BMI Calculation**: The app calculates the BMI using the formula: BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m))^2.

4. **Result Display**: The calculated BMI value is displayed to the user, along with a message indicating the BMI category (e.g., "Underweight," "Normal weight," "Overweight," "Obese").

5. **Clear Button**: The app also includes a "Clear" button to reset the input fields and clear the result display.

## Implementation Details

The app is developed using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.
